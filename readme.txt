Minimal theme focussed on simplicity, putting your writing front and center. 

=== How to Install ===

1. Using your favourite FTP client upload the folder titled "Sutra" to wp-content/themes/
2. Activate it by  visiting your administration panel Appearance > Themes > Sutra 

For more detailed information on how to upload themes or set-up WordPress 
visit this page: http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress


=== Theme Features & Usage Notes ===

A) Using your own Logo

Upload an image to show beneath the header text at Appearance > Header.
From the same screen you can hide the header text if desired.


B) Menus & Widgets

Without adding any widgets ( in the admin section Appearance > Widgets ) the left sidebar
will automatically show Menu, Categories, and Archives.  The menu section will automatically include
a "Home" link as well as links to every "Page" on your site.

To select what items you want to include in this menu visit Appearance > Menus, then;
1. Create a new menu named whatever you like (ie. top-navigation) and add items to it and save it.
2. In the theme locations box (top left of menu page) select the name of your menu from the drop-down list
beneath the words "Primary Navigation", press Save and you are all set.

Adding Widgets to the "Widgets" section will remove the Category & Archives sections, 
the Menu will remain.



C) Adding a Photo Gallery

To add a photo gallery just drop this shortcode into your post  [gallery]  ( include the square brackets )
This will create a blue box in your edit window, click on that and add images as normal.

The title of your image will be the title that shows on the individual image pages.

D)  Pagination

This theme has built in pagination so you do not need a plugin to add this functionality.  When the 
number of posts on a page reaches the number set in Settings > Reading "Blog pages to show at most"
then the page numbers will automatically appear.
